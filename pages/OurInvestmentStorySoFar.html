            2023 marked the 20th anniversary of our move to the then City of
            Manchester Stadium following the Commonwealth Games. Since this
            time, East Manchester has witnessed an amazing transformation,
            supported by over £700m of private sector investment, either
            directly by City Football Group, or through working in partnership
            with other private and public sector organisations:
