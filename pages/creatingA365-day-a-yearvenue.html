          By investing in world-leading facilities, we are creating a distinct
          destination at the Etihad Campus that will provide a fantastic
          experience for fans and visitors both on matchday and beyond.
        </p>

          alt="Etihad Campus"
        />
        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">NORTH STAND</h3>
        <p>
          Our development, which includes several connected facilities fully
          integrated into the stadium, are centred around an expanded North
          Stand with one larger, single upper tier above the existing lower
          tier.This will increase stadium capacity to over 60,000.
        </p>
        <img
          class="etihad-campus-img img-fluid my-4"
          src="/assets/Images/EtihadCampos/etihadcampus1.jpg"
          alt="Etihad Campus"
        />
        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">CITY SQUARE</h3>
        <p>
          Capable of accommodating up to 3,000 fans on matchday, and open to the
          general public on non-match days, our new covered City Square will
          provide a range of food and drink options alongside live
          entertainment.
        </p>
        <p>
          City Square will also be open all day on matchday giving fans the
          opportunity to arrive early or stay after the match to make more of
          their visit to the stadium.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, other sporting and community events will be held at the
          venue on non-matchdays.
        </p>
        <p>
          Providing more facilities, that can be used by visitors to Co-op Live
          and the wider Campus sporting venues, will play a key role in the
          development of the Etihad Campus Entertainment Destination.
        </p>
        <p>
          We anticipate that a broader range of activities offered to fans on
          matchday, and a covered venue where fans can spend more time, will
          smooth out peak travel movements and reduce congestion and demand on
          public transport.
        </p>

        />
        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">CLUB SHOP AND MUSEM</h3>
        <p>
          The relocation of the City Store will help to establish a much more
          enjoyable arrival experience from Joe Mercer Way and the Metrolink,
          opening up a direct visual connection with the stadium, with the North
          Stand and a new covered City Square acting as a focal point.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a design move that has influenced overall form and layout.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Club museum and exhibition space that were previously located on
          the first floor of the City Store will be incorporated into a new
          Manchester City museum experience.

        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">AN INTEGRADTED HOTEL</h3>
        <p>
          As there is currently no on-site overnight accommodation at the Etihad
          Campus we are developing a large hotel for use by fans and visitors
          both on matchdays and throughout the week.
