          In line with our development of City Football Academy and the
          expansion of the South Stand, ensuring that any new facilities create
          jobs, training and social opportunities for the local community in
          East Manchester remains a key priority.
        </p>
        <p class="text my-4">
          A combination of training, recruitment and employment policies are all
          being applied and prioritised for local people.
        </p>

          class="etihad-campus-img img-fluid my-4"

        />
        <p class="mt-4">
          The Etihad Stadium currently employs a large workforce to support its
          operation, however the majority of these jobs are temporary and mostly
          associated with match and event days at the Etihad Campus.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our development will now provide an opportunity – in conjunction with
          partners - to transform the Etihad Campus into a major employer of
          permanent jobs.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the hotel and our new food and drink operators, this will include:
        </p>
        <ul class="plan-list">
          <li>Catering And Service</li>
          <li>Hospitality</li>
          <li>Event Management</li>
          <li>Customer Care</li>
          <li>Cleaning</li>
          <li>Stewarding And Security</li>
          <li>Facilities Management</li>
          <li>Hotel Management</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We will ensure that new employment opportunities arising from our
          development are accessible to East Manchester residents and support
          the retention and attraction of talent to the city.
        </p>
        <p>
          The workspace will offer flexible leases to support the growth of the
          companies looking to start-up, as well as the more established
          companies looking to scale-up.
        </p>
        <p>
          Attracting these new organisations will provide a basis for future
          growth in jobs.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3 class="fw-bold my-4">SERVICE SECTOR AND TRAINING SKILLS ACADEMY</h3>
        <p>
          As part of our development, plans for a ‘Service Sector Training and
          Skills Academy’ are being explored. It is our intention to deliver
          this in partnership with Manchester City Council and an education
          provider.
        </p>
        <p>
          At present, formal education routes available for people who aspire to
          build a career in the hospitality sector, particularly those which
          offer real life practical experience as part of gaining
          qualifications, are low in number.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will ensure that the hospitality sector expertise required to
          manage our entertainment destination will be drawn from local
          neighbourhoods. We will support the development of skilled and
          qualified local people, who will be empowered to create an exceptional
          fan and visitor experience at the Etihad Campus, adopting hospitality
          as a career of choice.
        </p>
        <p>
          By offering distinctive learning and training opportunities connected
          to Manchester City Football Club and City Football Group, there is a
          huge opportunity to encourage and inspire people of all ages.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to young people who would like to start their career
          journey, we believe there will be many opportunities for people of all
          ages to retrain and enter the profession at other levels.
