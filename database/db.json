        "After three successful years at West Brom, Carson moved to Turkish side Bursaspor in 2011 and earned another England call-up in November 2011.",

        "Carson brought his experience to City’s goalkeeping team from 2019 onwards, eventually debuting in the 2020/21 season against Newcastle.",
        "He also appeared in the 2021/22 season against Sporting Lisbon and has continued to support Ederson and Ortega in the 2022/23 campaign.",
        "Carson was part of City's 2022/23 Premier League, FA Cup, and Champions League Treble-winning team.",

        "Ederson arrived at City on 1 July 2017 with a reputation as one of the brightest young goalkeeping prospects in world football.",
        "Born Ederson Santana de Moraes, he began his youth career in his native Brazil with São Paulo FC, before venturing into Europe aged 16 to sign with Benfica.",
        "It was in Portugal where his professional career began, initially with second-tier outfit Ribeirão, where his form earned him a move to Primeira Liga side, Rio Ave.",
        "During a three year stay, he played 63 games in all competitions and enhanced his reputation so much so that Benfica brought him back to the Stadium of Light in 2015.",
        "Ederson’s second spell in Lisbon began in the B team, as understudy to Brazil’s first choice ‘keeper, Julio Cesar, but he succeeded his compatriot in the 2016/17 campaign and helped the Eagles to a league and cup double.",
        "With a habit of producing excellent reflex saves and boasting outstanding distribution, Pep Guardiola swooped for the then 23-year-old in the summer of 2017.",
        "Ederson enjoyed a fantastic first campaign with City, keeping 16 clean sheets as an integral part of the Club’s Premier League success.",
        "His form earned him a PFA Young Player of the Year nomination and saw him selected in Brazil’s 2018 World Cup squad.",
        "In May 2018, he penned a new deal with City that tied him to the Club until 2025 and impressed again in 2018/19.",
        "Twenty clean sheets saw him named in the PFA Team of the Year, whilst he also saved a penalty in the shootout as City beat Chelsea to lift the Carabao Cup.",
        "Ederson’s fantastic footwork, including the sheer distance of some his kicks, has generated much admiration at the Etihad Stadium and in May 2018 he broke the Guinness World Record for the longest drop kick, registering 75.35 metres.",
        "Since his arrival, the majority of keepers in this country have changed the way they play, with the emphasis on playing from the back now commonplace for many teams in England.",
        "That means technique, control and distribution are all key elements for any top goalkeeper - though outstanding reflexes, agility and the ability to command the penalty area remain crucial.",
        "He was able to do enough between the sticks to help City beat the Europa League champions and lift the European showpiece for the first time in the Club’s history.",
        "Ederson also kept a clean sheet in the FIFA Club World Cup win over Fluminense in December 2023. "

        "The following summer Foden made the England Under-17 squad for the European Championships and scored in the final, where the Young Lions lost to Spain on penalties, but he returned to City for pre-season and was included in the first-team tour of the United States. ",
        "He produced several impressive displays and made several matchday squads in the early part of the 2017/18 season before departing for the Under-17 World Cup in India.",
        " And to top off arguably his best season for his boyhood club, Foden was named the Premier League Player of the Season after he scored 19 goals and assisted eight during his vital role in City laying claim to a historic fourth successive Premier League title. "
